# Rumble-To-RSS
Generates an RSS feed file from Rumble pages by scraping a URL for generic video info

Written (quickly) in jupyter and then converted by `jupyter nbconvert --to script main.ipynb`.

Just get this to run with some regularity and it can be considered a "dynamic" feed

--------------

Consider extending this with youtube-dl functionality (to add more accurate metadata and/or extend to other sites)
